        <p>Ganjam District derived its name from the word “Ganj–i–am” which means the “Granary of world”. From other
          sources it also revels that Ganjam District is named after the Old Township and European fort of Ganjam
          situated
          on the northern bank of river Rushikulya, which was the headquarter of the District. <br>
          The rock edicts of King Ashoka and the inscriptions clearly indicates that the present tract of Ganjam was a
          part
          of the Kalinga Empire, which was under the jurisdiction of King Ashoka. However after the disappearances of
          the
          Mauryan empire and the downfall of their absolute supremacy, the Ganjam region was also disappeared from the
          political scenario of Odisha and was in a dark oblivion till in 1761, it was recognised as The French
          Bussy.When
          the French arrived Ganjam District was sub divided into several parts.

          But the French were not destined to be at the helm of the administration of the Ganjam District for long and
          shortly the English envaded the French settlement in Deccan and finally became victorious in 1759. In 1794,
          with
          the establishment of the Collector office, the historical era of the British imperialism was set up in Ganjam.
          <br>
          From the historical documents of Ganjam District, it has been deciphered that the headquarter of the District
          has undergone several changes and has been shifted from one place to another. In 1855, the original
          headquarter
          of Ganjam was abandoned owing to the eruption of the epidemic fever in the town for which near about 80
          percent
          of the population of the town was reduced. Temporarily the capital was shifted to Gopalpur and then to the
          Berhampur and finally to Chhatrapur around 1902.
          <br>
          The District of Ganjam was far away from the Madras Presidency and the British didn’t find it easy to control
          the administrative activities far from Madras. Hence they merged it with Province of Odisha in 1936.
          <br>
          V.V.Giri, Biswanath Dash, Binayak Acharya, Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja, Sasi Bhusan Rath, Kabi Suriya Baladev
          Rath,
          Kalinga Bira Biju Patnaik, Raja Bahadur Ramchandra Mardraj Deo, Chakra Bisoyi and Padmasri Bhagban Sahu are
          some
          of the prominent personalities of Ganjam District.
          <br>
          Ganjam District has witnessed many historical events and monuments from its past. Jaugada fort stands as the
          symbol of all the historical heritage connected with the Rushikulya Valley civilisation. Athagadapatna is the
          birth place of famous Odia poets Kabisurya Baladev Rath and Kabi Jadumani Mahaptra.
